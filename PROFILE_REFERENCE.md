## Technical Notes

- All profiles are **bilingual** (English/Spanish)
- Profiles merge with base `translations.js`
- URLs are discrete - no obvious customization visible
- Each profile preserved all core data, only emphasis changes
- **No hash = 404 page** — prevents anyone from seeing the generic CV
- Invalid hashes also show 404
